Must be in git repo (clients all operate per repo)
  Host sends repo, branch and diff
  Workers checkout repo and branch, apply diff, and build specified files

If a worker fails to build, try on another worker?
  Could be a misconfigured worker?

Server can represent multiple repos
  Host will send repo name on the build request

Server
  Multiple workers per thread; needs to scale to 100 workers
  TUI interface
    Connected workers
    Current builds
    View of threads

Flow
  Server
    Ping/pong with clients regularly
    Keep track of client CPU usage

    Upon a build request (with a number of files), distribute them among clients
      Call back to host with any files that could not be distributed: no workers?

    If a worker build fails, tray another worker? (misconfiguration)
      Ultimately relay error info to host

  Client
    Have make determine what files need to be built
    Make new connection with server as a host and send repo, branch, diff, and files
    Build other files locally and listen for completions (or errors) from the server
      If we're a worker, just have the server assign us work?
